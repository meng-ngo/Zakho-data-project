Zakho city may have been originally established on a small island in the little Khabur River which currently flows through the city. The river itself flows west of Zakho to form the border between Iraq and Turkey. This border represents the largest land border in the Kurdistan region and become now an important check point through which hundreds of thousands of trucks pass every year. Due to its strategic location and the abundance of job opportunities, Zakho has attracted many workers and job seekers from different parts of Iraq and even from Syria and Turkey. The town itself has lots of shops and commerce activities and is a major market place for commodities and merchandise serving not only the Kurdistan region, but also most of the middle and southern parts of Iraq.</p>\n",

In 1844, the traveler William Francis Ainsworth commented: «The appearance of Zakhu in the present day coincides in a remarkable manner with what it was described to be in the time of Xenophon.» Gertrude Bell, an important British archaeologist, was convinced that Zakho was the same place as the ancient town of Hasaniyeh. She also reported that the first Christian missionary to the region, the Dominican monk Poldo Soldini, was buried there in 1779. His grave was still a pilgrimage destination in the 1950s.</P>\n",

      "                                        Zakho is the border town between Iraq and Turkey, where a huge border complex was constructed in Ibrahim Khalil, which is a suburb north to Zakho. Due to its strategic location and the abundance of job opportunities, Zakho has attracted many workers and job seekers from different parts of Iraq and even from Syria and Turkey. Zakho has around 90,000 habitants and the town itself has lots of shops and commerce activities so expect lots of trucks and taxis. Zakho has served as a checkpoint for many decades. It is a major market place with its goods and merchandise serving not only in the Kurdistan region, but also serving most of the middle and southern parts of Iraq. Campanile (1818) described the town as a great trading centre, famous for its gallnuts as well as rice, oil, sesame, wax, lentils and many fruits. Zakho is located just 20km from the Turkish town Silopi, so lots of Turkish trucks come with export good to provide Kurdish region with everything one can imagine. Trade with Turkey is now the major element of the economy. Oil-drilling began in 2005. There is the Delal Bridge over the Habur River and an amusement park that are somehow worth a visit if you’re willing to stay overnight and spend a couple of hours in this tiny border town.</P>\n",

      "            Zakho city is located in the Duhok governorate just a few kilometers away from the Iraqi- Turkish border and with about 190,000 inhabitants. Zakho city may have been originally established on a small island in the little Khabur River which currently flows through the city. The river itself flows west of Zakho to form the border between Iraq and Turkey. This border represents the largest land border in the Kurdistan region and become now an important check point through which hundreds of thousands of trucks pass every year. Due to its strategic location and the abundance of job opportunities, Zakho has attracted many workers and job seekers from different parts of Iraq and even from Syria and Turkey. The town itself has lots of shops and commerce activities and is a major market place for commodities and merchandise serving not only the Kurdistan region, but also most of the middle and southern parts of Iraq.\n",

In 1844, the traveler William Francis Ainsworth commented: «The appearance of Zakhu in the present day coincides in a remarkable manner with what it was described to be in the time of Xenophon.» Gertrude Bell, an important British archaeologist, was convinced that Zakho was the same place as the ancient town of Hasaniyeh. She also reported that the first Christian missionary to the region, the Dominican monk Poldo Soldini, was buried there in 1779. His grave was still a pilgrimage destination in the 1950s.\n",

      "                                        Zakho is the border town between Iraq and Turkey, where a huge border complex was constructed in Ibrahim Khalil, which is a suburb north to Zakho. Due to its strategic location and the abundance of job opportunities, Zakho has attracted many workers and job seekers from different parts of Iraq and even from Syria and Turkey. Zakho has around 90,000 habitants and the town itself has lots of shops and commerce activities so expect lots of trucks and taxis. Zakho has served as a checkpoint for many decades. It is a major market place with its goods and merchandise serving not only in the Kurdistan region, but also serving most of the middle and southern parts of Iraq. Campanile (1818) described the town as a great trading centre, famous for its gallnuts as well as rice, oil, sesame, wax, lentils and many fruits. Zakho is located just 20km from the Turkish town Silopi, so lots of Turkish trucks come with export good to provide Kurdish region with everything one can imagine. Trade with Turkey is now the major element of the economy. Oil-drilling began in 2005. There is the Delal Bridge over the Habur River and an amusement park that are somehow worth a visit if you’re willing to stay overnight and spend a couple of hours in this tiny border town.\n",

The river itself flows west of Zakho to form the border between Iraq and Turkey. This border represents the largest land border in the Kurdistan region and become now an important check point through which hundreds of thousands of trucks pass every year. Due to its strategic location and the abundance of job opportunities, Zakho has attracted many workers and job seekers from different parts of Iraq and even from Syria and Turkey.

Campanile (1818) described the town as a great trading centre, famous for its gallnuts as well as rice, oil, sesame, wax, lentils and many fruits. Zakho is located just 20km from the Turkish town Silopi, so lots of Turkish trucks come with export good to provide Kurdish region with everything one can imagine. Trade with Turkey is now the major element of the economy. Oil-drilling began in 2005.
